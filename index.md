## Practical Experiences and Personal Projects
Practical Experiences:
* Winner of the Award for best scientific initiation presentation in his work entitled: ¨Secflow: Unsupervised learning for analysis and detection of anomalies in Computer Networks¨ at the Extended Proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium on Information Security and Computational Systems (SBSeg23). In this research, I applied the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to detect anomalies in computer network traffic.
* Try Hack Me CTF's: I completed the following paths of the platform: Pre Security, Introduction to Cyber Security and Complete Beginner, where I could learn about the areas within Information Security, I learned Linux, I came into contact with some of the main vulnerabilities of the OWASP Top 10, I got in touch with BurpSuite and I was able to learn fundamentals of Web and Networks. At the moment, I have been focusing more on the Security part in Web applications following the rooms on the platform and I intend to continue solving the “paths” of Try Hack Me. So far, I have completed 55 machines from Try Hack Me.
* Black Hat Python projects: Building a GitHub-Aware Trojan, Keylogging for Fun and Keystrokes, Taking Screenshots, Pythonic Shellcode Execution, Sandbox Detection, Creating a Process Monitor, Process Monitoring with WMI, Windows Token Privileges, Code Injection, etc.
* Code in Place Stanford 2020: Course offered during pandemic by Stanford with online classes and interaction between students and volunteers.
* IBM Behind the Code 2019: IBM programming marathon in Brazil with a series of challenges to solve.


Personal Projects:

* My blog/Medium: I love to help other people learn and share my opinions. This was the way that I found to help and return knoledge to the cybersecurity community.
* Felipe Talks: It's a project created to talk about technology, cybersecurity, computer science and this whole universe, with the objective of helping the Brazilian community and more people to get started in the field. I share a lot of content on instagram, tiktok, youtube, etc. It's amazing to be able to bring more people into this world and be part of it.

## University Iniciatives and Activities

* Published an article in progress in the Extended Proceedings of the Brazilian Symposium on Information Security and Computational Systems (SBSeg23): Secflow: Unsupervised learning for analysis and detection of anomalies in Computer Networks. [LINK](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbseg_estendido/article/view/27297)

* Volunteer at Congress of the Brazilian Computer Society 2022 (CSBC). The Congress of the Brazilian Computer Society (CSBC) is an event held annually since 1980 by SBC and aims to integrate the Brazilian Computing community, promotes and encourages the exchange of experiences between the scientific, academic and professional communities.

* Neodroid is a game developed by Rodrigo Barroso, **Felipe Salles** and Vitória Guidine for the subject Lab of Games 2021.1 of Universidade Federal Fluminense's Computer Science course. Neodroid is a game contextualized in a dystopian future that is passing by an robot vs human war, and it's up to Ada, an intelligent cyborg, programmed to kill other machines, solve the problem. But... what makes her different from the other robots? What makes her different from the humans? It's up to her to decide it... or isn't? [LINK](https://rbarroso.itch.io/neodroid).

* Walking stick developed with my university group only using a few cheap components. Hardware only.
